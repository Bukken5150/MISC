Item  |Qty | Notes
 ----|----|----|
CAN Toolhead |1 | You should already have this , maybe go pull it out of the garbage since you got so frustrated with CAN and threw it away
USB C Male Breakout board |1| [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ANMBEST-Connector-Receptacle-Adapter-Support/dp/B09WCQKSW1/) 
USB C Female Breakout board |1| [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/UMLIFE-Type-C-Breakout-Connector-Converter/dp/B0BL77R71Q/) ..Now you can use the female breakouts from the first link , i just prefer this style since you can mount it to a din rail and solder a JST header to it
JST Header 2-4pin (optional) |1|
M2 self tapping screws |2|

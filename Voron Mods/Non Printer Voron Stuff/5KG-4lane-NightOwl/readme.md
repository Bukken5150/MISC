## Dual Nightowl Mod

this mod of the [NightOwl](https://github.com/mjonuschat/NightOwl) allows you to run 1 of the 3 configurations 

* 1x 5kg spool and 2x 1kg spools (this is how i currently use mine)
    ![1](./5KG-4lane-NightOwl/Images/1.png)
* 4x 1kg spools (similar to boxturtle, bambu AMS, etc..)
    ![2](./5KG-4lane-NightOwl/Images/2.png)
* 2x 5kg spools (not pictured)


this has only been tested by me and im sure i have missed some things , it also may differ from stock NightOwl

i dont have plans to make any updates to this at the moment either


Thanks to [mjonuschat](https://github.com/mjonuschat) for making the original NightOwl

I went with the external [Meanwell GST220A24-R7B](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01515NRL2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
there are 2 inlets you can choose from , both of them fit in the stock inlet hole adn use the same inlet, one just uses one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Tnisesm-Mounted-5x20mm-Holder-Socket/dp/B08JHM2DQY/ref=sr_1_11) fuse holders and the other uses has a 16mm hole for a 16mm switch 
[KJPX-PM-4S inlet](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/kycon-inc/KPJX-PM-4S/9990081) that works with the meanwell PSU linked above
